    "\n",
    "Welcome to the second assignment of course 4. In this assignment you will explore summarization using the transformer model. Yes, you will implement the transformer decoder from scratch, but we will slowly walk you through it. There are many hints in this notebook so feel free to use them as needed. \n",

    "\n",
    "Before submitting your assignment to the AutoGrader, please make sure you are not doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have not added any _extra_ `print` statement(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "2. You have not added any _extra_ code cell(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "3. You have not changed any of the function parameters.\n",
    "4. You are not using any global variables inside your graded exercises. Unless specifically instructed to do so, please refrain from it and use the local variables instead.\n",
    "5. You are not changing the assignment code where it is not required, like creating _extra_ variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do any of the following, you will get something like, `Grader not found` (or similarly unexpected) error upon submitting your assignment. Before asking for help/debugging the errors in your assignment, check for these first. If this is the case, and you don't remember the changes you have made, you can get a fresh copy of the assignment by following these [instructions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/attention-models-in-nlp/supplement/shBOS/how-to-refresh-your-workspace)."

For example, bots can be used to scrape articles, summarize them, and then you can use sentiment analysis to identify the sentiment about certain stocks.

    "article = \"In a traffic jam, sweating from sitting in the sun, I’m headed home. When I saw the grocery store in front, I thought, “No!” Let’s wet the throat! “ I went to buy coke. He saw that the price of a bottle of 250 ml is Rs 18, whereas 400 ml of the same coke of the same company is available at 25 taka. All you need is a little wetting. Which one will you take? 250 ml or 400 ml? Most people will take 400 ml. Because, 150 ml of coke for only 7 taka, getting more! No profit? Yes, it might be worth it. But, for the need of 18 rupees, that 25 rupees had to be spent? Let’s talk about a few more incidents, suppose you went to eat at a fast food chain. Just wanted a burger, but saw that there was a special offer going on. A burger — a packet of French fries and a Coke — is just Rs 300. You are a great fan of Coke! And the special offer means a lot of discounts! Sada took the combo pack without thinking about it. Later, while paying the bill, you saw that if you took 3 separately, the price would have been Rs 305, and the one you came for — the burger, cost Rs 200. That is, spent 100 rupees more to save 5 rupees! Many more such incidents happen constantly in our daily life. These are examples of ‘choice architecture’. The various decisions that we have in different areas in our daily life, how they are presented to us, are controlled by some other factors including the surrounding environment — and, thus, the work of arranging the options to answer the question in front of us by analyzing the various factors is ‘choice architecture’. A choice architect creates different options, environments or situations such that; So that we do not decide as he wants or we react according to his needs! In 2008, Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein published a book called “Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness”. There, Theler gave a theory called “Nudge theory”, which is a very popular theory in behavioral science and economics, and for this he received the Nobel Prize in 2017. In the book, he explains Choice Architecture, how it can influence the decisions we make in our daily lives using behavioral economics. Answers to the same question in different styles may vary based on the style of questioning, arrangement of options, and environment — for the same person. If you think that you are independent, that what you decide is entirely your own — that no one has any influence on it, that is a misconception; And research shows that almost 70% of people believe in such a concept. But, the truth is, choice architecture has an impact on a variety of decision-making in public and private sectors such as retirement savings, deciding insurance schemes, policy making, how you make decisions — it is being influenced in different ways. Behavioral economists mainly use choice architecture to reduce various biases or to provide better benefits to people. Again, many companies use it for their own gain as well. We will see their usage in various elements in detail. The elements of choice architecture are: 1. Number of Choices / Options: Classical economics thinks that more options are beneficial to customers, they can check all the options and make the best decision for them. But, the problem is, making this decision requires additional time, necessary knowledge — intelligence and mental labor, which not everyone has. So it’s not always right. Behavioral economics tells us to change this number according to the target. Now it can be used in two ways. While buying mobile data we often don’t understand which package will be best for us — combination of so many packages — so much data — deadline — price! What is the result? 68% of the time we spend more money than we need — and a lot of data is left empty at the end of the term! In this way, mobile operators confuse our choice and take money in their pockets! et’s take another example, a government health insurance. There are two packages — one is normal and the other is premium. And they have advantages and disadvantages. Then it will be easier than ever for you to choose the one that suits you? Of course! Won’t you benefit more? Of course! 2. Environment: A group of researchers in America once posed as environmental activists and called people in different areas to talk about ‘global warming’. After they speak, give a form to collect feedback and donations. We should all be equally concerned about ‘Global Warming’, because we all have to suffer its consequences. But, are we all equally aware? They take the opinion of the person filling the form, his home postcode and donation information. And later, from the postcode they deduce the weather (temperature etc.) in that area at that time of day. It can be seen, where the temperature is higher in those areas, the amount of people thinking about ‘global warming’ and the amount of donations! here is also a difference between online form filling and paper printed forms. People’s interest, thinking and willingness to donate is greatly reduced in paper form. Then it’s okay if the font is small on a small paper! Donation is far away, if we can hear something! 3. Default: (Default Option) It is very important in choice architecture. Default is a condition or option, if you choose it, you may not have to provide a lot of information on your own, but some information set by command will automatically sit here. We often see this in our daily life. When people don’t understand the range of options, or are confused or indecisive by their surroundings, most people do one thing — the default option. For example, you have to go to the union office 3 miles away to fill a form. You went and saw, after giving the name-address in the form, a 2-page instruction, then a 5-page form. And written in the corner — ‘Choose defaults’, next to a small tickbox. what to do. Another such thing is, “Recommended”. We think that what would be best for us is probably set to the default/recommended, but that’s not always the case. We regularly open accounts on various websites or give permission to use cookies, or privacy policies. How many of us read the whole thing? not one Just — Accept All.In America once seen on government car insurance, people in one state spent 10–15 billion dollars more than people in another state. Because, their default was — ‘Premium Package’, and others’ default was ‘Basic Package’. But the amount of money is not low at all! So it’s not wise to check Default/Recommended all over the place! 4. Confusion about time: We are also influenced by things/thoughts that will happen in the future. Most of the time we think about the current good, or short term benefits. In trinomial podcast, Khalid Farhan proposes a deal with Enayet Chowdhury, where he gives two options — instant fixed amount and percentage amount from profit or as an affiliate, and he also informs that he will get more money as an affiliate, but late. There will be some uncertainty. But, even Enayet Chowdhury took the option of Instant Fixed Amount. Why? We are always uncertain about what will happen in the future, afraid of harming ourselves. Meanwhile, there is an interesting thing. When dealing with finances we think we might not have money in the future — we try to save or be safe. But, our preference for pleasure/desire is more than money, such as giving tours and eating, we think less about money at these times, “Yes, I spend, no money, money will come to hand! How much money comes!” Knowing that it may harm, we all eat the French fry on the sidewalk with great fun! There are many other issues involved in choice architecture or choice engineering. Basically, we are not in full control of everything that happens in our lives — we are influenced in various ways from around us. Knowing these is very important for everyone to make good decisions.\"\n",
