# Syllabus
### WEEK 1
## Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression
- Learn to extract features from text into numerical vectors, then build a binary classifier for tweets using a logistic regression!
- 15 videos, 13 readings, 1 practice quiz
- Graded: Logistic Regression

### WEEK 2
## Sentiment Analysis with Naïve Bayes
- Learn the theory behind Bayes' rule for conditional probabilities, then apply it toward building a Naive Bayes tweet classifier of your own!
- 13 videos, 11 readings, 1 practice quiz
- Graded: Naive Bayes

### WEEK 3
## Vector Space Models
- Vector space models capture semantic meaning and relationships between words. You'll learn how to create word vectors that capture dependencies between words, then visualize their relationships in two dimensions using PCA.
